                            What do the James Bond movie <em>Goldfinger</em>, Tom Clancy’s novel, The <em>Cardinal of the Kremlin</em> and the United Technologies Research Center have in common? They are all loves of Tony DeMaria’s, because they encourage the exploration of science and laser technology. Dr. DeMaria came to America from Italy when he was five years old, grew up in a tough Waterbury neighborhood, and worked construction jobs to help his family and support his education. His father was a janitor with limited education and his mother was a garment worker with no education. He struggled to learn English, had a stutter, and didn’t fit in well until 8th grade. In spite of these challenges, he went on to become one of Connecticut’s greatest contributors to scientific advancement and technology. To what does he owe his success? To a fascination with science that as a youngster included geology and astronomy, and to his family physician, who in 1950 advised him to study electronics, “an exploding field” after World War II. This advice led Dr. DeMaria to his favorite hobby and lifelong career: laser research.
                            Dr. DeMaria graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1956 with a degree in electrical engineering. He began his first job, working on radar applications for Anderson Laboratories. It wasn’t long before he realized that applied physics was his true passion; he began attending night classes at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Hartford, earning a Masters Degree in Science. A turning point in his life occurred in 1959, when he read Nobel laureate Charles Townes’s theoretical paper on lasers; this encouraged him to enroll in a PhD program in both electronics and physics at UConn. His 1965 thesis led to his  greatest  breakthrough — generating picosecond laser pulses, whose time durations lasted the time it takes light to travel the thickness of a sheet of paper. These ultra-fast laser pulses made it possible to probe atoms and molecules and measure their relaxation rates, a discovery that led to overnight fame and his election to the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, and as president of the Optical Society of America. He is a founding member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering and a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.

                            In 1994, Dr. DeMaria retired from United Technologies to start DeMaria ElectroOptics Systems, LLC (DEOS) with the purpose of transferring laser radar technology to commercial use. In 2001, DEOS was acquired by Coherent, Inc, becoming Coherent-DEOS, LLC located in Bloomfield, where he serves as chief scientist. He is very proud of his company, which has created over 200 new jobs in Connecticut and exports over 75% of its laser products worldwide. He continues to make valuable contributions to the scientific community as he sees his role “progressing from scientist to manager to an entrepreneur.” Dr. DeMaria has been awarded 55 patents and continues to develop new ideas.
                            “Technology is what makes the world go around,” says Dr. DeMaria. “Countries with good technology are the global economic leaders.” He believes that unfortunately “many Americans are intimidated by science and technology, which are not only very important fields for keeping us competitive in a world market, but are also fields of great interest, reward and excitement.” Dr. DeMaria tells young people not to “believe that people in technology are the nerds portrayed on television and in movies. Scientists and engineers contribute greatly to the economic health and well-being of the world, while enjoying life and having fun too!”

                        Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company, is the 2020 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Technology in recognition of X2 Technology, a generational leap in rotary-wing innovation that enables helicopters to complete tasks traditional helicopters can’t today. X2 Technology consists of an integrated package of technologies that make X2 aircraft faster, more agile, and more maneuverable than other helicopters.
                        Sikorsky has been a leader in aviation and innovation ever since Igor Sikorsky founded Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation in 1923. Sikorsky helicopters have transported every U.S. president since 1957 and have also fulfilled aviation needs across all branches of the military. In 2004, engineers started work on X2 Technology to overcome the speed and stability limitations of prior helicopters. These limits drove Sikorsky engineers to completely rethink the typical design of a helicopter. X2 Technology consists of: counter-rotating rigid rotor blades, fly-by-wire flight controls, hub drag reduction, active vibration control, and an integrated auxiliary propulsion system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        In 2010, Sikorsky’s X2 Technology Demonstrator reached 250 knots, before its final flight the program was honored with a prestigious Collier Award, which recognizes the greatest achievements in aeronautics or astronautics in America. Sikorsky donated the aircraft to the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. The Company’s work then shifted to address the U.S. Army’s future vertical lift needs. The S-97 RAIDER is the second X2-based helicopter. Sikorsky’s newest design, RAIDER X is based on this design and will contend for the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program. Sikorsky, in partnership with Boeing, developed the SB>1 DEFIANT, a larger design that is now in flight test and informing the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program. The evolution of X2 Technology through each phase of design and flight test have proven the scalability of this game-changing technology.
                        “Sikorsky engineers represent the most innovative minds in our industry,” said Dan Schultz, Sikorsky President. “Their passion for excellence continues to expand the boundaries of helicopter speed and maneuverability. I am extremely proud that our team’s work has paved the way to meet the needs of the Army’s Future Vertical Lift program.” Sikorsky’s engineering and manufacturing expertise is a significant economic force in the state, with currently 7,900 CT-based employees. X2 Technology will directly benefit the state’s economy. “Connecticut is proud to award the 2020 Connecticut Medal of Technology to Sikorsky,” said Governor Ned Lamont. “Connecticut is home to the nation’s most innovative and talented aerospace and defense manufacturers and suppliers— and companies like Sikorsky keep us competitive by continuously providing exciting new opportunities for top engineering and science graduates from our state’s colleges and universities. Sikorsky is to be congratulated for their ongoing innovations and commitment to the state of Connecticut and our workforce.”

                <p>
                        When Yaakov Bar-Shalom was a teenager in Romania, he enjoyed listening to the BBC or Voice of America, something which was considered “pretty dangerous under the Communist regime.” However, by the time he was nineteen, he and his family had emigrated to Israel, where after only four months, Yaakov had learned enough Hebrew to continue his studies and graduate Cum Laude from Technion in Haifa, Israel, where he earned a Bachelor’s Degree and later a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering. Following this, he earned his PhD from Princeton University.
                        Today, Yaakov Bar-Shalom is a University of Connecticut Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the Marianne E. Klewin Endowed Professor in Engineering, and is the recipient of the 2012 Connecticut Medal of Technology for his work in improving the sensitivity of remote sensors used for surveillance in the presence of background noise or clutter.  According to Anthony DeMaria, 2004 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Technology and Chief Scientist at Coherent-DEOS, LLC, Professor Bar-Shalom is regarded as the “chief architect of probability-based methods for estimating the paths of moving objects.”
                        Professor Bar-Shalom notes that a turning point in his career came two years after he received his PhD and was working for a company on developing a tracking algorithm that could work in presence of “clutter.” At the time, his direct manager believed he was “wasting company time” and recommended that he be fired.  Fortunately, the company vice president stepped in and asked a professor from a well known university to evaluate the work. The professor declared that Bar-Shalom’s algorithm “made sense,” thus saving his job! Professor Bar Shalom states that “the ultimate compliment I received from this professor was that he later used my results in another consulting job, with the appropriate credit given to me.” Before Professor Bar Shalom’s work in the early 1970s, the field of multiple target tracking was largely dependent upon ad-hoc algorithms with little theoretical foundation. In the mid-1970s, he introduced the Probabilistic Data Association and Joint Probabilistic Data Association, both of which were theoretically sound and practical for application.
                    </p><p>
                        Professor Bar-Shalom’s research has improved the sensitivity of remote sensors used for either radar or sonar surveillance. This is particularly significant for national defense because it permits early detection of approaching hostile targets, making a timely counterattack possible. Professor Bar-Shalom’s work also solved a very challenging problem for airports, which have numerous objects that can confuse a conventional tracking algorithm. The sensors based on his algorithms enhance air transport safety and are used by Raytheon in their airport surface detection radar systems operating at numerous airports from Boston to New Delhi.
                        Professor Bar-Shalom credits his high school math teacher, affectionately referred to as “M-squared” with first inspiring his interest in pursuing a mathematical career. “Fortunately, I managed to retain everything this math teacher taught.” After completing high school at age 16, Professor Bar-Shalom studied at the Polytechnic Institute in Bucharest, Romania, for his first three college years. There, his professor, who taught Electromagnetics, showed him “the elegance of mathematical modeling and instilled in me the desire to pursue new ideas.”
                        Professor Bar-Shalom believes that “young people should develop the stamina to pursue the study of mathematics, science, and engineering because it is rewarding and is the key to society enjoying the benefits of modern technology.” He cites Theodore von Karman, an aerospace engineer awarded the first National Medal of Science, who said “Scientists discover the world that exists; Engineers create the world that never was.”’

                        Before Professor T.P. Ma began graduate work at Yale, he considered himself fluent in English. After all, he had excelled in English studies since eighth grade, and listened to American radio broadcasts of music and news. However, one day during a first-term math course taught by a British professor, T.P. arrived to class to find the room empty. He was confused. Where was everyone? Fortunately, he saw a classmate who explained that class was cancelled to provide study time for the next day’s major exam.  T.P. was astounded, and spent that day and night preparing for the exam. Afterwards, he kept a radio by his bedside, falling asleep to late night talk shows to improve his listening skills. Now, almost forty years later, Professor Ma is not only fluent in English, but his outstanding contributions in the field of engineering render him one of the greatest scientists of our time and the 2008 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Technology.
                        Tso-Ping Ma was born in the northwestern corner of China. Four years later, his parents fled Communism to settle in Taiwan, where he completed his education through college. After a year of military service, T.P. applied to Yale University, where he was accepted in 1969 and began work in semiconductor research. Professor Ma considers a serendipitous introduction to the “visionary” Richard Barker, his future mentor and advisor, to be a critical turning point in his career. Professor Barker enthusiastically embraced Ma’s interest in semiconductor research, arranging for grants from Bell Labs. At that time, the industry standard for gate dielectrics on semiconductors was 1,000 angstroms and “no one believed that they could be condensed to anything less than 100 angstroms.” T.P.’s thesis research on electron tunneling through ultra-thin gate dielectrics proved that it was indeed feasible to create a gate dielectric on semiconductor that functioned at 20 angstroms.
                    </p><p>
                        Semiconductors transmit electronic information. Gate dielectrics are insulators for this electron transmission, and as Professor Ma explains, “the insulator is like a wall upon which electrons are thrown, some electrons will seep through if the wall is too thin.” The task for Professor Ma was to strengthen the silicon dioxide gate dielectric with minimum quantities of nitrogen, allowing information to be most efficiently transmitted, without electrons leaking in the process.  His work paved the way for high-k dielectrics, further extending the scaling limit. Ma is now researching a new type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), to save energy, increase memory and provide far faster methods of communication for personal and industry use in everything from cell phones to medical and defense technology.
                        Professor Ma believes many young people do not realize their potential for making a difference. His mother encouraged him to pursue engineering to make significant contributions to society. Beyond his work on gate dielectrics, some of his many contributions include: chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Yale, co-director of the Center for Microelectronic Materials and Structures at Yale, election to the National Academy of Engineering and the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering, and recipient of the 2006 Semiconductor Industry Association Award and the IEEE Andrew S. Grove Award. He advises youngsters to develop a strong foundation in math and science to have the needed tools.  Tso Ping Ma would like to be remembered as an innovator who “believes in the use of technology to improve society, and an educator who brings up the next generation of innovators.”

                    <p>
                        In 1967, a Yale student wrote a wistful melody celebrating love’s tender memories. This song, <em>Time After Time</em>, became the second most frequently performed song by the renowned à cappella group, the Yale Whiffenpoofs. The student composer and Whiffenpoof musical director, Robert &quot;Pitchpipe&quot; Birge (Yale ’68), continued to compose — and went on to complete a few other noteworthy accomplishments as well, including creating a protein-based disk drive in1982, pioneering the use of spectroscopic and theoretical methods to study biological molecules, and most recently, working to develop an artificial retina that will bring functional sight to those who would otherwise be blind.  Robert R. Birge is the Harold S. Schwenk Sr. Distinguished Chair of Chemistry, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Connecticut and the 2009 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Science.
                        Bob grew up on Long Island. His mother was a musician and his father a teacher who, while encouraging his interest in music and science, “didn’t push him in any way.” When he was 12, he wrote his own music, enjoying improvising and creating rather than traditional practice routines. He enrolled at Yale as a chemistry and music major.  During a sophomore year music competition, his concerto was well received but did not earn top placement. He recalls that his professor did him “an enormous favor by pushing him towards the sciences.” After graduating with a B.S. in chemistry, Bob began graduate work at Wesleyan University. Studying chemical physics, he worked under the mentorship of Peter Leermakers on “high resolution molecular spectroscopy of retinals” to better understand how “light drives the isomerization of the retinal chromophore,” and creates a change in the geometry of protein molecules responsible for vision. Dr. Birge says he was always interested in understanding how systems operate at the molecular level and then moving to investigate the larger system functions, whereas many other scientists work in the opposite direction — analyzing the function of a system in order to understand the underlying mechanisms.
                    </p><p>
                        His research on protein molecules and their response to light led him to work with a 3.5 billion-year-old archaeal protein called bacteriorhodopsin, found worldwide in salt marshes. This simple protein is among the earliest life forms converting sunlight into energy and is similar to the visual protein rhodopsin. Researching bacteriorhodopsin provides insight into understanding how rhodopsin activates the nerve impulses essential for vision, paving the way for the development of an artificial retina.
                        Dr. Birge believes that his greatest contribution is the development of the artificial retina, now five to ten years from completion. His next most valuable contribution, he says, was as musical director of the Whiffenpoofs — and <em>Time After Time</em>. He suggests that young people “follow their dreams and find something to do that genuinely interests them” because if “you love something you will find your niche” and that passion will pull you through difficult times. Dr. Birge advises young people to “stay open to new opportunities and not always listen to your parents,” but do find ways to make meaningful contributions. Dr. Birge certainly has learned from his own experience; his vast contributions include over 225 refereed articles. He served on the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering Committee on Energy Alternatives and Conservation in 2007, established a new center for Nanobionics at the University of Connecticut, was elected to the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering and the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2005, earned the 3M Award of Canada in Physical Chemistry and the Connecticut Innovations 2001 Annual Technology Award. Dr. Birge gives of himself tirelessly in his role as teacher and colleague, providing the University of Connecticut with an outstanding program that attracts top students and faculty to the state.

                        Modern flight is not powered by a single game-changing technology or stand-alone innovation. It’s built on thousands of breakthrough technologies and new ideas working together. And, its future depends on fast, flexible thinkers relentlessly exploring every opportunity, big and small, to advance its progress.
                        Pratt & Whitney’s employees drive innovation into every part, process and service. From the smallest detail of engine design to the last stage of the manufacturing line, they are improving how engines are manufactured, how they perform and how they are serviced.
                        The 2018 Connecticut Medal of Technology for developing geared turbofan (GTF) technology is a testament to Pratt & Whitney’s innovative spirit and commitment to customers. This 92-year-old company has inspired generations of innovators to work together, transforming every great idea into practical and comprehensive solutions.
                        Over the last few decades, jet engines transformed transportation; however, they remain noisy, fuel-guzzling polluters. Pratt & Whitney engineers thrive on this type of challenge, and attack it by taking a known concept further than anyone could imagine.
                    </p><p>
                        The Challenge: Jet propulsion of aircraft relies on engines to accelerate incoming air by compressing and burning it, then exhausting the gases at high speed, creating forward thrust for aircraft propulsion. The problem with a conventional jet engine is that the fan in the front that provides the thrust spins relatively slowly compared with the rear turbine that spins fast for the best fuel efficiency. With both powered by a single shaft, the architecture of jet engines had been about compromising so neither one spun at optimum efficiency. In other words, the rotational speed mismatch between the low speed fan and the high-speed gas turbine powering the fan prevented high propulsive efficiency. That architecture, unchanged for decades, created increased fuel burn, emissions and even noise because the speed of the fan’s revolving tips was supersonic, and that meant it created shock waves from drag.
                        The most logical architecture for enabling the fan and the turbine to turn at optimum speeds turned out to be the architecture of the GTF engine. This technology enabled high propulsion efficiencies with lower fuel burn and less noise, while incorporating advances in aerodynamics, lightweight materials and technology improvements in the high-pressure spool, low-pressure turbine, combustor, controls, and engine health monitoring.
                        Pratt & Whitney has a long history of disrupting the jet engine market. The company was founded by innovator Frederick Rentschler, who introduced the WASP radial piston engine in the 1920s. The engine he developed relied on air-cooling technology that changed the way aircraft engines are cooled (previous engines were water-cooled). Throughout the subsequent decades, Pratt & Whitney continued to lead the way with revolutionary technology, spurring the rapid development of commercial aviation including work on the GTF engine, which began in the 1990s.
                        And the rest is history – or, rather, the future.
                    </p><p>
                        Pratt & Whitney’s GTF technology achievements have resulted in a 16% reduction in fuel burn for the PurePower® GTF engines currently in operation - the equivalent of removing three million cars from the road. This reduction also has significant environmental impacts, reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by 50%. The reduced C02 emissions are equal to filling 850 hot air balloons with C02 and floating them away. Further environmental impacts are evidenced in the GTF engine’s 75% reduction in ground level noise compared to the engines it is replacing, making it a preferred engine for airports located in residential areas.
                        Pratt & Whitney believes that powered flight has, and will continue to, transform the world – and that advances in engine technology open the door to new eras in aviation. The new age of aviation that Pratt & Whitney’s GTF engine signals will be as transformative as all of the evolutionary advances that preceded it.  The work is hard, but Pratt & Whitney empowers employees to “Go Beyond” – turning possibilities into realities for its customers.

                        The boy was only fifteen when he was arrested and sent to Mauer bei Wien, a Nazi labor camp. A few weeks later he was released, only to be rearrested and with his father, packed on a train headed toward Dachau, one of Hitler’s infamous concentration camps. The boy convinced his father to jump with him from the train. Hiking through the dangerous countryside, they managed to find their way back to Vienna. Sadly, the Nazis found his father and sent him to an internment camp in Poland and that was the last time the boy saw his father. Through a tireless effort, his mother secured them passage on a ship bound for America and a new life. The year was 1940 and the boy was Heinz Joseph Gerber, who grew up to become one of the most eminent inventors of the 20th century and the recipient of numerous awards including the 1994 National Medal of Technology Award and the 1995 Connecticut Medal of Technology. He was granted several honorary doctorates and more than 670 US and foreign patents. Joseph Gerber was a man who will be remembered for his brilliance, creativity, energy and generous spirit.
                        Joe Gerber arrived in Hartford and in two years, completed Weaver High School while working jobs in hotels, tobacco fields, and a bakery, all the while learning English. He earned a scholarship to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, graduating with a B.S. in aeronautical engineering. One night, during his junior year at Rensselaer, he fell behind in his engineering homework. An ingenious young man with a knack for spontaneously inventing ways to solve problems, he used the waistband from his pajamas to fashion a calibrated computing device that helped him solve his math problems and would later launch his career. This device is now known as The Gerber Variable Scale, hailed as the most revolutionary tool since the slide rule, and the company he started in 1945 became Gerber Scientific, Inc. Today, Gerber Scientific is a company worth half a billion dollars and employing two thousand people, with worldwide sales.
                    </p><p>
                        Joe was always looking for problems to solve. Before the advent of computers in the 1950s, he designed data reduction equipment, including the Derivimeter and the Equameter which give the derivative and the equation of a curve respectively, and the GraphAnalogue, an improved version of the Variable Scale. These instruments are now part of a permanent collection at the Smithsonian Museum
                        Later in his career he designed a tool that transformed the US apparel industry struggling to compete with overseas markets. His innovation is the GERBERcutter®, which cuts large quantities of material with a computer-controlled knife. It provided jobs to thousands of Americans. Joseph Gerber, together with the people he mentored, changed the way manufacturing is done in this country. Gerber Scientific is responsible for the development of cost-cutting and time-saving design and manufacturing methods that transformed drafting, cartography, circuit boards, automotive, aerospace, apparel and other flexible materials, signs, billboards, printing prepress and lenses for eyeglasses.
                        Joseph Gerber believed that young people should find their passion and work to cultivate their interests. He was a natural teacher who valued learning for learning’s sake. His children remember him saying, &quot;Education is the wings on creativity.&quot; He loved science, as he believed it to be an essential part of life, something which provides both truth and beauty, enables human creativity, and improves our standard of living. Although he was a disciplined man who vastly contributed to the world of engineering and business, “he never lost his childhood curiosity” or his “love for America.”

                            As a second grader, Jonathan Rothberg spent a lot of time in the principal’s office. He struggled with reading and, too often, found himself in trouble with his music teacher. However, his mother’s belief that he would one day “do good science,” coupled with his father’s engineer’s emphasis on solving problems, formed the foundation for his later accomplishments. Of course, it didn’t hurt that that there was a chemistry laboratory in his basement where he spent hours experimenting, or that at thirteen, he was given one of the first “hobby” computers by his older brother Henry, and taught to program by his other older brother David. These childhood experiences cultivated his problem solving abilities. When he arrived at Carnegie Mellon University to begin his training as a chemical engineer, he discovered that he was “best at solving problems that no one had solved before.” Jonathan, whose early school life was marked by difficulty, was, by his junior year of college, sequencing DNA, and envisioning ways to do it better – much better. Today, Jonathan Rothberg, PhD, is best known for inventing a way to decode your genome — the biological “program” (the “book of life”) stored on the 23 pairs of chromosomes in each of your cells that makes you unique — and is the recipient of the 2010 Connecticut Medal of Technology.
                            After completing college, Dr. Rothberg attended Yale University, earning a PhD in biology. His thesis work — decoding a gene responsible for wiring the nervous system — appeared on the cover of the prestigious journal <em>Cell</em>. He realized that he “wanted to do this work on a big scale” and to develop medicines. To accomplish this, he started CuraGen. At CuraGen he was the first to completely map out how the proteins encoded in a genome functioned together (featured on the covers of <em>Nature</em> and <em>Science</em>) and develop drugs for the treatment of metastatic skin and breast cancer.
                            When his son Noah was born in 1999 and rushed, not breathing, to newborn intensive care, Jonathan realized he wanted to develop drugs based on personal genomes.  While his son was in the intensive care unit, Dr. Rothberg invented the first fast way to sequence DNA and founded 454 Life Sciences. This technology allowed for decoding genomes at a rate never before possible, enabling the first sequencing of an individual human genome — that of James D. Watson, who co-discovered the structure of DNA.
                        </p>

    <p>
                            Dr. Rothberg also initiated the Neanderthal Genome Project, cracked the mystery behind the disappearance of the honey bee, uncovered a mysterious virus killing transplant patients, and elucidated the extent of individual human variation — work recognized by <em>Science</em> magazine as the breakthrough of the year for 2007.  The <em>New England Journal</em> described Dr. Rothberg's sequencing innovation as enabling “The New Age of Molecular Diagnostic...” <em>Science</em> magazine called it one of the top 10 breakthroughs for 2008.
                            Recently, Dr. Rothberg has taken his research further with the creation of Ion Torrent. Ion Torrent is leveraging semiconductor technology to create the first “personal genome machine.” This invention of Dr. Rothberg’s, a sequencing machine on a chip, translates the chemical information in your genome directly to digital information, making genome sequencing an inexpensive and powerful part of medicine, much like the invention of the computer chip did for computing.
                            Dr. Rothberg is widely published, was twice named as The World Economic Forum's Technology Pioneer, is an Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year and received The <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s First Gold Medal for Innovation. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering, and serves on the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University. He is indeed doing “good science.”

But that’s just what he became: a chemist and CEO of his own company, ATMI, that employs over 750 people worldwide with a market capitalization exceeding one billion dollars. Despite these accomplishments, he wants to be known best for his contributions to the progress of mankind.
                        Dr. Banucci came from humble beginnings, growing up in Racine, Wisconsin. His father worked for the railroad, his mother in a retail shop. Dr. Banucci recalls that he was thirteen when Sputnik went into orbit. This event “catalyzed an interest in all things scientific;” later, in high school, his chemistry teacher made chemistry “a lot more fun.” An avid reader, Dr. Banucci was the first in his family to go to college. He earned a scholarship to Beloit College, where he majored in chemistry. He credits his professors with developing his speaking, writing and leadership skills — skills he believes are critical to being a good scientist. After completing his PhD in organic chemistry at Wayne State University, he was hired by General Electric Company where he developed his first patent at the age of 29.
                        “Creativity without the opportunity to create doesn’t do much,” he says, and he feels lucky to have both. He believes he inherited his creativity from his father, whose family was very creative. Dr. Banucci’s inventions are his creative and scientific response to needs that require attention. He explains that his company’s greatest invention and the one of which he is proudest, derived from meeting a fire chief.

                        The story begins in Silicon Valley, where microchips that power computers, cell phones, and Game Boys are manufactured. In emergencies, firefighters were reluctant to enter chip manufacturing plants because of toxic gases used in the manufacturing process. The fire chief asked if the storage and use of these gases could be made safer.
                        Dr. Banucci and his team learned of work being done on trapping these dangerous gases in absorbent materials containing millions of tiny holes. These new materials acted like sponges, except the gases completely adhered to the material and could not be released simply by opening a canister. Dr. Banucci and his team redesigned the material by changing the size of the holes, thus allowing workers to safely extract the gases. The end result, the SDS (Safe Delivery System), is now employed in every chip manufacturing plant in the world, making both the workplace and environment safer.
                        Dr. Banucci has this advice for young people, “Our world is changing at an increasingly faster and faster pace. Science and technology are driving those changes. If young people today do not understand the scientific reasons that explain the changes, they will have little chance to adapt. It’s not the strongest of the species that survive but the most adaptable.” Dr. Banucci has been a member of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering since 2007.

                            In junior high and high school, during the post-Sputnik era, Fred Leonberger heard lots of talk about space exploration, microelectronics, and a new device &mdash; the laser. After all, he grew up near Washington, DC, in a neighborhood populated with NASA and Naval Laboratory engineers who were ready role models for a boy interested in science and mathematics. However, his fascination did not end with high school, but instead, grew into a lifetime of work dedicated to researching and creating high-speed optical modulators that helped to make possible the modern means of broadband fiber optic communication used worldwide. Fred Leonberger’s career has spanned nearly forty years of research and development of important optical devices &mdash; including leadership in product and business strategy &mdash; cultivating innovative ideas into functional and beneficial products.  Frederick J. Leonberger, PhD, is the 2014 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Technology.
                            When Dr. Leonberger was considering which college to attend, he knew he would need some financial aid. His neighbor, Dr. Eugene Beach, encouraged him, in fact enabled him, to attend the University of Michigan. After Fred was admitted, Dr. Beach helped him get a part-time job in the university’s nuclear engineering department, where he worked for all four years, “doing whatever was needed from answering phones to helping in the Engineering Library,” until his junior year when he was able to do engineering work. He graduated with a bachelor’s of science engineering in electrical engineering, continuing his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a master’s degree and a PhD in electrical engineering. He then worked at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory for ten years, serving during some of this time as an associate leader for a 60-person group that developed cutting-edge opto-electronic and photonic components.
                            In 1984, Dr. Leonberger joined the United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in East Hartford, CT, as manager of Photonics and Applied Physics, where he was responsible for programs in six research groups. He led the development of a LiNbO3 integrated optic modulator, which has found extensive commercial applications in fiber optic communications, CATV signal transmission, fiber optic gyroscopes, and other applications. The major technologies developed in Leonberger’s UTRC groups have all spawned commercial Connecticut businesses:  United Technologies Photonics (UTP) in Bloomfield; CiDRA, in Wallingford; and DEOS, now part of Coherent, in Bloomfield. After UTP was acquired by JDSU, Fred went on to become chief technology officer of that company. He currently heads his own technology advisory firm, EOvation Advisors, LLC.
                            “The world is changing very rapidly because of technology,” says Dr. Leonberger, “Therefore it is important for young people to develop some understanding of a variety of technologies and their potential impact on future change.” He is particularly excited about recent advancements in nano-electronics and -photonics, and in brain science and genomics.  He suggests that young people “explore lots of different fields of study, especially including science and technology, and follow your passion that will allow you to make contributions to whatever endeavor you choose.”
                            “Every place I‘ve worked I have learned from others.  My contributions and inventions have built on their work” states Dr. Leonberger. He enjoys the dynamism of multiple individuals coming together to grow each other’s ideas, giving birth first to research and then to new products. Dr. Leonberger shares the belief stated so well by Sir Isaac Newton: “If I have seen future directions, it was by standing on the shoulders of giants.”

                        Charlie Kaman was not easily discouraged. In the 1940s, when others thought helicopters were frivolous designs with little potential for the aerospace industry, Charlie was hard at work in his mother’s garage, developing an improved model with a 1933 Pontiac engine. The work he did that day and the years to follow changed his life and the lives of thousands who have been airlifted and rescued from the jungles of Vietnam and the waters off Iran in helicopters manufactured by the Kaman Aircraft Corporation - the company that Charlie Kaman started in 1945 by selling $1,000 in stock to each of two close friends. Among many accomplishments Kaman developed the first gas turbine-powered helicopter, now on view in the Smithsonian Museum.  He and his company also developed the servo-flap, the first twin turbine helicopter; in 1957, the first remote control helicopter; and the first production all composite rotor blade.
                        Charles Kaman grew up in Washington, D.C. His father was a German immigrant who supervised construction on the Supreme Court. As a youngster, Charles set records for hand-launched model gliders, dreaming of becoming a professional pilot. When a tonsillectomy left him deaf in one ear, he had to change plans. In 1940 he earned a bachelor’s degree in aeronautical engineering from Catholic University. He turned down a job with the Tommy Dorsey Band to take a position in the propeller performance unit at Hamilton Standard, a division of United Aircraft, where he met aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky. In a speech to the Wings Club in 1996, he said “At that moment, something clicked. I knew Igor was onto something big. I revered Igor Sikorsky, and I always retained a tremendous amount of respect for what he accomplished.”
                    </p><p>
                        After becoming head of the aerodynamics department, he partnered with Sikorsky to design rotors for helicopters needed during WW II. This work required application of the Goldstein Vortex Theory to analyze performance of airplane propellers in hovering and vertical flight—a tedious, time-consuming endeavor that frustrated his efforts to efficiently complete the necessary calculations. Since PCs had not yet been invented, Mr. Kaman essentially invented his own: “At home on my own time, I began designing a special computer with the hope of reducing dramatically the time required for individual point calculations. I created a new calculating machine, which I called the Aerodynamic Calculator. The device, which used relays, switches, condensers and electronic tube circuits working on logarithmic scales, reduced the calculation time to five minutes.”
                        Charles Kaman’s interests extend beyond helicopters and aerodynamics. He was an avid music and animal lover, a guitarist who used his knowledge of helicopter design to build guitars with a natural sound from aerospace composites. The round-backed Ovation guitar laid the foundation for a music division, which would become the largest distributor of musical instruments in North America. Mr. Kaman and his wife, Roberta, also founded the Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation, dedicated to training guide dogs for work with the blind. This organization is unique because it not only bred suitable dogs, but started an &quot;in-community&quot; training program whereby instructors bring dogs into the home to train both pet and owner. The Kamans were awarded the Melvin Jones Fellows by Lions Club International for their years of service to the blind.
                        Charles Kaman lived his personal credo – success hinges on one’s determination to work hard despite obstacles which ultimately serve to “sweeten the fruit of success.”  His life’s work yielded many honors, including the 1997 National Aeronautic Association's Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy, the 1996 National Medal of Technology, the 1996 Connecticut Medal of Technology, and the US Department of Defense Distinguished Public Service Medal. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering.

                        When Cato T. Laurencin, MD, PhD, was a child in inner-city Philadelphia, his home included his mother’s family medical practice with a laboratory in the back of the house. This is where the foundation for Dr. Laurencin’s interest in science and medicine, as well as his desire to make the world a better place, was formed. Dr. Laurencin credits both his parents and his grandmother with mentoring his creativity and scientific curiosity, along with other mentors later in his academic life including: Dr. Robert Langer at MIT and Dr. Henry Mankin at Harvard Medical School.  Today, CASE member Cato T. Laurencin, is a world-renowned physician-scientist in orthopaedic surgery, engineering, and materials science, and the 2016 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Technology.
                        Dr. Laurencin attended Central High School in Philadelphia before entering Princeton University, where he completed his undergraduate degree in chemical engineering, followed by a medical degree Magna Cum Laude from Harvard Medical School. During medical school, he also earned a PhD in biochemical engineering/biotechnology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology because “I wanted to delve into science in a comprehensive way. I wanted to take more course work, and dedicate time to solve an important problem.” Some important problems Dr. Laurencin is working to solve focus on soft tissue musculoskeletal regeneration and the development of new materials and implants for bone regeneration. He is the scientific founder of Soft Tissue Regeneration (STR), a Connecticut company commercializing technologies for anterior cruciate ligament regeneration (knee) and rotator cuff regeneration (shoulder).
                        Dr. Laurencin states, “I think I’ve been able to go to the mountaintop three times in science. I’ve worked on nanomaterials (nanofibers), some 1/100th the size of hair in diameter, and produced some of the first work showing how we can use them biologically to make tissues. I’ve worked on combining polymers and ceramics in unique ways to create new and useful materials to help people, and I’ve used polymeric materials to develop what we call soft tissues such as ligaments and tendons and shown they can work to create these tissues.” In addition to STR, Dr. Laurencin is Scientific Cofounder of Natural Polymer Devices (NPD), a Connecticut company dedicated to developing polysaccharide polymer technologies for bone regeneration and a fracture repair device for the treatment of cervical spine fractures.  He has also worked on the development of an antibiotic delivery system for the treatment of osteomyelitis (bone infections) and an antitumor delivery system for the treatment of brain tumors.
                    </p><p>
                        Among the recognitions Dr. Laurencin has received for his extraordinary contributions to medicine and technology, he is the 8th designated University Professor in the history of the University of Connecticut. The school’s highest faculty distinction, it is a rare title given to individuals for extraordinary academic excellence and outstanding achievements in administration at the school. He is the first orthopaedic surgeon to be elected to both the National Academy of Medicine and the National Academy of Engineering. The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons has honored him with their highest award, the Nicolas Andry Award, while the American Institute of Chemical Engineers named him one of the 100 Engineers of the Modern Era at its centennial celebration.  His work, some of which was highlighted in National Geographic Magazine’s &quot; 100 Discoveries that Have Changed the World&quot; edition has earned him the Founder’s Award from the Society for Biomaterials.
                        Dr. Laurencin serves as the Founder and Director of the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Center for Biomedical, Biological, Physical, and Engineering Sciences, and the Founder and Director of the Institute for Regenerative Engineering at UConn Health.  Internationally renowned, he has been elected to membership in the Indian National Academy of Sciences, the African Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. With that said, Dr. Laurencin is proud of his work here in Connecticut, “I am particularly honored that people have recognized me for playing a leading role in the development of the Bioscience Connecticut initiative. Linking science with innovation and showing how innovation fosters new discoveries, healthier people, and jobs is something that is important to me.”  With Bioscience Connecticut firmly in place, he has embarked on another new initiative.  Dr. Laurencin is undertaking the Hartford Engineering a Limb Project&mdash;the H.E.A.L Project.  The goal is to create a knee in seven years and an entire limb by 2030. Dr. Laurencin admits, “It’s bold,” but will be achieved “by making the impossible, possible and turning the possible into likely.”
                        Dr. Laurencin is very committed to making a better world “for science to grow.” As he was mentored, he believes mentoring the next generation of young people is critical to success. He has enjoyed witnessing “large numbers of people that I’ve mentored and influence go on to great success, and mentor others.” He is the recipient of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Mentor Award and received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Math and Engineering Mentoring in ceremonies at the White House. In January 2016, Dr. Laurencin was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, bestowed by the President of the United States and the highest honor the United States can confer to a US citizen for achievements related to technological progress.  More recently, the Society for Biomaterials awarded the first Cato T. Laurencin, MD, PhD Travelling Fellowships. Named in Dr. Laurencin’s honor, the award focuses on providing opportunities to young people pursuing science—a fitting legacy to his life’s commitment.
