        Professor Ruddle is a pioneering immunologist who discovered lymphotoxin, an immune signaling molecule or cytokine and demonstrated its roles and mechanisms in cytotoxicity, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Type 1 diabetes, and in lymph node development. Her work was fundamental to the understanding of tertiary lymphoid organs, accumulations of lymphoid cells that are damaging in autoimmunity but can be key to defense against microorganisms and tumors. She will accept the award at the 46th Annual Meeting of the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering to be held virtually on May 27, 2021.
        Professor Ruddle’s discoveries have profound implications for the understanding and treating of autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation, and cancer. Before the tools of molecular biology were available, she developed T cell clones and realized that the cytotoxic factor she discovered was a combination of the cytokines lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) . Lymphotoxin was one of the first cytokines to be discovered; now there are hundreds. Her findings that cytokines can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) and contribute to autoimmune diseases changed thinking in the field.

        “Connecticut has a rich history of being home to some of the nation’s leading scientists who are making revolutionary discoveries that have global impacts,” Governor Ned Lamont said. “Our state’s scientific community reflects our legacy of research and innovation. Professor Ruddle’s paradigm-shifting contributions to our understanding of the immune system, and infectious and autoimmune diseases is a shining example. On behalf of the entire state, I want to thank Professor Ruddle for her more than 50-year career — all of which has been spent in Connecticut — and congratulate her on receiving Connecticut’s highest honor for scientific achievement.”
        Professor Ruddle earned a BA in Zoology from Mt. Holyoke College and a PhD in Microbiology from Yale University. She received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Cytokine Society and was its President and has served as a role model for and made numerous contributions throughout her career to advancing women. Dr. Ruddle co-authored a textbook on Immunoepidemiology, the first textbook written on this subject. She has authored or co-authored over 200 publications, spanning primary research, reviews and commentaries. Her publication on the crucial role of lymphotoxin in lymphoid organ development was chosen as a “Pillars in Immunology” paper in the Journal of the American Association of Immunologists and the paper led to a new field of study.

        As a child during World War II in the former Yugoslavia, Pasko Rakic relied on reading to help escape the tragedy and sadness of losing his grandfather, uncle and cousins. Although his parents did not have university educations, they loved and collected books. An avid reader, Rakic often read subjects above his age level, including entries from the encyclopedia. He also enjoyed painting and creating wooden models of trucks and airplanes, particularly since toys were not available during the war. Later, Rakic attended an Austro-Hungarian style high school that emphasized classics, literature and philosophy. He was an exceptional student who enjoyed vigorous discussions, often taking positions against the authorities and established dogmas. His independent thinking eventually led him to a medical breakthrough in the understanding of neural cell development, making him the “single most important contributor to our current understanding of the development of the cerebral cortex.”
        Professor Rakic entered medical school at the University of Belgrade, where he was exposed to the work of Nobel Prize winner Santiago Ramón y Cajal, considered the father of neuroscience. Professor Ramón y Cajal wrote articles accompanied by detailed illustrations of complex nerve cells that sparked Rakic’s interest. After receiving his MD, Rakic began a neurosurgery residency in Belgrade and in 1962 he was awarded a Fulbright fellowship in neurosurgery at Harvard University. There, he met neuropathologist Paul Yakovlev, who introduced him to the “joys of studying the development of the human brain.” Since Rakic believed he could achieve a deeper understanding of neural development through research rather than surgery, he returned to the University of Belgrade and earned a PhD in developmental biology and genetics in 1969. His thesis provided the first experimental evidence that “cerebral cortex neurons do not generate locally but arrive in the cortex through a process of migration.” He returned to Harvard and continued research that led to the discovery that stem cells, which produce neurons, guide their progeny to proper positions in the brain. Professor Rakic “defined molecular mechanisms and proposed nomenclature for these developmental events that have been adopted as a generic blueprint for the evolution of the vertebrate nervous system.”
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1978, Rakic was recruited to Yale as the Dorys McConnell Duberg Professor of Neuroscience and Professor of Neurology. At Yale, he continued to study brain development, discovering evidence that the number of neurons and their connections decline selectively to adult levels during puberty and adolescence. The processes he has identified influence our understanding of developmental disorders of childhood, including autism and intellectual disabilities. His observations have also informed our understanding of psychiatric and neurologic disorders of adulthood including schizophrenia, dementia, and epilepsy.
        Professor Rakic is one of the founding recipients of the Kavli Prize, considered the most prominent neuroscience prize in the world. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Science, National Academy of Medicine and of numerous foreign academies. He has mentored some of the most transformative neuroscientists in the world, including: Professor Carla Schatz, Director of the Bio-X Initiative at Stanford University; Professor Pat Levitt, Simms/Mann Professor of Developmental Neuroscience at USC; and Professor Nenad Sestan at Yale, who leads the nation’s largest initiative on the molecular signatures of primate and human brain development.
        Professor Rakic advises young people to select “some basic conceptual question and/or specific disease, rather than focusing on the methodology and the latest techniques.” As he notes, methods change, but basic biological questions remain, and “we in basic science are lucky, like artists, to work on not what we are told, but on what we are interested in.” He would like to someday be remembered as a self-made scientist who took advantage of the freedom and opportunities that were offered in the United States to pursue his interests and to do what he desired.

@if (Name == "RobertSchoelkopf")

    <p>
        Robert Schoelkopf remembers always wanting to be a scientist. When he was six years old, he was given a rock hammer and with this tool, decided he wanted to be a geologist. A few years later, he watched <i>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau</i> and thought he would like to be a marine biologist. When he was sixteen, his parents brought him to Yale University for a Saturday morning Applied Physics program, and he discovered his true passion – to study physics.
        Professor Robert Schoelkopf, Sterling Professor of Applied Physics and Physics and Director of the Yale Quantum Institute, is the 2017 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Science for his seminal contributions to the entire field of quantum science. He and his collaborators, Yale Professors Michel Devoret and Steven Girvin, have created the new field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) that allows quantum information to be processed and distributed by microwave signals on wires.
    </p>

    <p>
        Schoelkopf grew up in Chappaqua, New York, and attended Horace Greeley High School, meeting his first mentor, Rossyln Zook, a chemistry teacher with whom he completed an independent study. When he studied physics later in high school, he discovered a natural affinity for this aspect of science that “was so broad and fundamental, but with an experimental aspect” because he “always liked building things.”  Physics seemed intuitive to him with its “simplicity and purity.” After Schoelkopf graduated from Princeton, he was “inspired by the Challenger disaster” and the risks scientists took to explore new frontiers. As a result, he worked for two years at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, where astrophysicist Harvey Moseley mentored him and he discovered that he “liked best what the physicists on the team were doing.” He realized he wanted to continue to study physics, and in particular, the use of low temperature physics to build sensitive instruments for astrophysics. Professor Schoelkopf recognizes the interconnective nature of science where, for example, techniques he learned from radio astronomy could unexpectedly be applied to quantum computing. After earning his PhD from the California Institute of Technology, Professor Schoelkopf came to Yale in 1995 as a postdoctoral fellow where he pursued research in low temperature physics.
        Professor Schoelkopf believes we are in the midst of a “second quantum revolution” with physicists, electrical engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists applying the transformative ideas of quantum mechanics to the field of information science.  His research focuses on quantum bits, or qubits, that exist in two states — 0 and 1 simultaneously — enabling a type of “quantum parallelism” in which “massive amounts of information can be stored and otherwise impossible tasks can be accomplished.”  Schoelkopf’s simplest and best qubit design — the transmon qubit — holds the record for coherence time and has been adopted by groups worldwide. Professor Schoelkopf’s other inventions include the Radio Frequency Single-Electron Transistor and the Shot Noise Thermometer.
        Professor Schoelkopf would like young people “to trust science but understand that it is always changing.”  While noting that some ideas are well established, Schoelkopf believes by testing, experimenting and building upon already proven theories, we can always improve our understanding of how the world works. “Science is an imperfect process, but is self-correcting. What you know is important, but what you think you know and what you do not know are even more important.” He notes that “all physicists like to think that our work is useful, but might only be applicable in another generation or two. But in our field, we are seeing significant changes in the world resulting from quantum computing, all within our working lifetimes.”  Professor Schoelkopf’s papers in journals such as <i>Physical Review Letters, Science, and Nature</i> are cited more than 2,000 times each year. He is on the Thomson-Reuters List of highly influential scientists, and his 2004 paper founding the field of circuit QED has garnered over 1,800 references so far.  In 2015, Professor Schoelkopf co-founded Quantum Circuits, Inc. (QCI), a private venture to develop, manufacture, and sell quantum computers based on the technologies for superconducting circuits developed at Yale. Above all else, Professor Schoelkopf would like to be known as a good father and husband, and a good collaborator and mentor, adding, “it’s likely that our team at Yale will be known as the inventors and founders of a whole new kind of technology and a new industry. That is really exciting and gratifying.”

@if (Name == "JoanSteitz")

    <p>
        Professor Joan Steitz believes in the importance of serendipity in science and emphasizes the significance of thinking broadly to discover what is hidden from view. Although Professor Steitz is referring to scientific discovery, her belief is reflected in her achievements as a woman in a profession traditionally dominated by men. If scientists like MIT’s Alex Rich, The Carnegie Institution’s Joseph Gall and Cold Spring Harbor’s James Watson had not thought broadly about women working in labs, then perhaps Professor Steitz would not have made the profound discoveries she is known for today, including the role of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) in pre-mRNA splicing.  Joan A. Steitz is Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale University, an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine and the recipient of the 2015 Connecticut Medal of Science Award.
        Steitz credits her very encouraging father and attendance at an all-girls high school with forming the foundation for her later scientific accomplishments. She attended Antioch College where internship is an academic requirement. As part of her work-study experience she interned in Alex Rich’s lab at MIT, where she researched DNA and first learned of its double helix structure. “I was enthralled. The work combined my interests in biology, genetics and chemistry. It was mind blowing,” she says. Upon graduation in 1963, with only physicians as role models for women in science, Steitz believed her best path would be to attend Harvard Medical School. However, in 1963, during the summer before beginning medical school, she worked in Joseph Gall’s lab, then at the University of Minnesota, where she was given her own project to pursue. This was the turning point. The excitement and sense of accomplishment that accompanied performing her own research motivated her to change direction and switch from studying medicine to biochemistry and molecular biology at Harvard. She became James Watson’s first female advisee, noting, “I had taken his course and did really well and became the first female grad student he had ever accepted.
    </p>

    <p>
        After Steitz finished her degree at Harvard, Watson wrote to DNA pioneer and colleague Francis Crick at Cambridge to recommend that he consider her for his lab. While working in Crick’s lab, Steitz made astounding discoveries about mRNA, specifically how it is able to accurately translate genetic information from DNA, where the information is stored into the proteins through the process known as base pairing. Professor Steitz’s work on base pairing led to further understanding of gene expression with the discovery that snRNPs mediate pre-mRNA splicing—research that has critical therapeutic application in many inherited and autoimmune diseases. Recently, her laboratory has found that one of the viral RNA elements that stabilizes mRNA levels does so by forming a triple helix with the poly-A tail of the mRNA (Science 2010).
        Professor Steitz teaches Yale undergraduates, and serves as a mentor and research adviser to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Her advice to young women is to not worry too far in advance about balancing career and family but rather accept challenges one step at a time. She would like “to be remembered fondly by all her trainees, to be respected for what she has done and for helping others along the way.” With Joan Steitz’s leadership, Yale’s Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry is recognized as one of the nation’s best.

        Curiosity is at the heart of all scientists, believes Professor Thomas A. Steitz. He recalls always wondering about what gives substances color and later, while a student at Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin, he learned about the structure of molecules that produce color. Over the years, Professor Steitz’s curiosity led him to “want to understand how the structures of biological macromolecules can explain how they work,” opening the door to our current understanding of the mechanisms by which the proteins and nucleic acids involved in the central dogma of molecular biology carry out gene expression, from replication and recombination of the DNA genome, to its transcription into mRNA, followed by the translation of mRNA into protein. Most recently, Professor Steitz’s work on the ribosome has led to the development of new classes of antibiotics to treat multiple-drug resistant bacterial infections. Steitz, Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale, is widely published and has earned numerous awards and recognitions including the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry which he shared with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Ada Yonath. In 2001 Professor Steitz and his colleagues founded Rib-X Pharmaceuticals, a company developing antibiotics to treat tuberculosis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, and <em>Escherichia coli</em>. In 2013, Thomas A. Steitz is honored with the Connecticut Medal of Science.
        Thomas Steitz was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1940. His father was the head of personnel at the Milwaukee County Hospital while his mother stayed home to raise Thomas and his two younger brothers and two younger sisters.  In junior high school, he became a serious saxophone player and even considered majoring in music; however, at Lawrence College, the influence of Professor Robert Rosenberg changed the course of events, helping Tom “understand the world around him because he introduced to us the concepts of atomic orbitals and bonding and how studying chemistry at the physical chemical atomic level allowed us to understand the properties of chemicals.” Tom continued his education at Harvard University where, in 1966, he earned his PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology. After Harvard, he traveled to Cambridge, England, and worked in the Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), annually attending a week-long meeting known as “Crick week” because “Francis [Crick] would sit in the front row and frequently ask many questions.” In 1970, Frederic Richards from Yale visited the LMB, and Tom asked if there might be a spot for him at Yale. There was. At Yale, Professor Steitz teamed with other faculty to form the Yale Center for Structural Biology, where his efforts focused on the study of the ribosome, “the major target of antibiotics.” Professor Steitz explains that the ribosomes are the binding site for 50% of the antibiotics used world-wide; however, because ribosomes mutate, a mutant ribosome can become resistant to antibiotics, requiring researchers to continuously develop new antibiotics. Professor Steitz is quick to point out that all the “intelligent design” that researchers produce cannot compete with the “evolution of bacteria.” Fortunately, ribosome research “allows us to have more information to enable the design of antibiotics.” Professor Steitz is gravely concerned about the misuse of antibiotics and the potential worldwide catastrophe of drug-resistant bacteria.
        Professor Steitz reflects that each of us wants to be remembered for doing good things and for being a good person. “I’ve had a lot of people in my lab who have gone on to do good things, and I hope they are happy for having been in my lab.” In particular, he would like to be remembered for the same qualities as Frederic Richards, the 1995 Connecticut Medal of Science Award, whom he sees as his hero. Fred Richards was “just an exemplary scientist, person and leader and we loved to follow him. I would like to be a Fred Richards who had the insight and wisdom to hire and cultivate other scientists.”

        Steven L. Suib came from a family where “everything and everyone was believed to be important.” His parents emphasized respect—regardless of culture, religion or background—and, at times, brought hitchhikers home for a warm meal.  His grandfather, an artist, travelled the world painting portraits of notable leaders, providing a role model for an independent, adventurous life. Growing up in rural northwestern New York State, Steve was introduced to the natural world by his father, an entomologist, as they canoed remote areas and collected butterflies or waited into the darkness of night to photograph moths. Steven’s earliest introduction to chemistry took place in the family’s garage, where he mixed formulas for his father’s pest control business. These unique and varied influences coalesced to form Professor Suib’s “interest in understanding the relationships between many different things and solving fundamental problems to create a better world.” Dr. Steven Suib is a Board of Trustees Distinguished Professor at the University of Connecticut and the 2011 recipient of the Connecticut Medal of Science Award.
        During high school, Suib was mentored by two outstanding chemistry teachers: Nora Keyser and Nancy Rodriguez. They allowed him to work in the lab “making solutions, grading papers, setting up experiments, and generally learning about the field of chemistry.” Later, he attended the State University of New York at Fredonia, where, for a very brief time, he majored in music. During his freshman year, a geology elective convinced him to combine his passion for the outdoors with his interest in chemistry. A later turning point occurred when he performed research involving crystal growth of semiconductors and ways to study these materials. Steven graduated magna cum laude in 1975 with a double major in geology and chemistry. His initial plan was to teach high school, but encouraged by his advisor, Paul Weller, Suib pursued doctoral studies at the University of Illinois at Champaign Urbana, where he earned a PhD in chemistry and completed coursework equivalent to a master’s degree in geology.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the past ten years, Professor Suib has headed the chemistry department at the University of Connecticut. His work focuses on developing new approaches to solve fundamental problems, specifically in the field of catalysis and materials science and involves the synthesis of novel porous semiconductors used to make new chemicals for use in lithium batteries, oil spills, and other applications. The central question Professor Suib asks is, “Can we make materials that no one else has made using relatively simple materials?” In his quest to “make new things,” Suib and his team are investigating the creation of synthetic fuels using carbon dioxide—a greenhouse gas—and water, research that could contribute to both reduced greenhouse gases and the development of alternative energy sources. Professor Suib states, “It’s not easy to find ways around Mother Nature” and that is where inorganic catalysts that mimic nature become crucial to producing key results. His research team is working closely with VeruTEK Technologies, Inc, a Connecticut company dedicated to “innovative green technologies,” to clean up contaminated industrial and commercial properties and landfills using microemulsion catalysis that converts hazardous and toxic compounds into harmless materials. Other current research involves synthesizing high temperature ceramic fiber composites used for aircraft engine parts.
        Over the years Professor Suib has collaborated with industrial researchers in Connecticut such as United Technologies Research Center, Pratt and Whitney, Hamilton Standard, Olin, Yardney Technical Products, Pfizer, ATM, APSI, VeruTEK, Rogers Corporation, Uniroyal, Crompton and others. He is also the Head of the Pratt Center of Excellence in Ceramic Chemistry. These efforts have contributed immeasurably to Connecticut’s technological and economic development.
        His advice to future generations is the same as his father gave to him – “recognize that everything is interrelated and important.”  Professor Suib believes “if we can work hard, develop skills, and encourage creativity, then our most difficult problems can be solved.”

        “Doing science is like doing puzzles,” notes Dr. Michael Snyder, Director of the Yale Center for Genomics and Proteomics and the recipient of the 2007 Connecticut Medal of Science Award. Dr. Snyder should know, since he studies one of science’s greatest puzzles—the mystery of the human genome. Dr. Snyder’s research provides explanations for how and why we are each different from one another, as well as helps scientists to “understand the basis of mutations and genetic disease.”
        Michael is the fifth child in a family of six children. He grew up in rural Pennsylvania, where his father worked as an accountant and his mother was a schoolteacher who instilled a “great curiosity about everything.” Michael spent much of his childhood playing outside, and helping care for the family’s pets and farm animals. It was in an advanced high school chemistry class that his formal interest in science was sparked by a teacher who gave Michael and his fellow students freedom to conduct their own experiments. Michael’s early achievements were recognized with the Bausch & Lomb Honorary Science Award, paving the way for his entrance to the University of Rochester, followed by his graduate studies at the California Institute of Technology. At Cal Tech, Michael trained with Dr. Norman Davidson, a pioneer in researching recombinant DNA, and one of the most influential people in Michael’s career. While working with Drosophila (fruit flies), Michael discovered that a particular gene was inactivated by a piece of DNA that jumped around in the genome. This early discovery and his subsequent postdoctoral work with Dr. Ronald Davis at Stanford University, who stressed the value of creating one’s own tools, led Michael “to research fundamental biological questions with novel technological approaches.” In his own laboratory at Yale University, he pioneered approaches for studying thousands of genes and proteins at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dr. Snyder uses a car analogy to explain his work. If we want to understand how a car operates, it is not enough to observe only one component: we need to observe how many parts are integrated and work together. It is the same with genes and their system of operation. In the past, scientists were able to study only one gene at a time, but by working with yeast and then later with human cells, Dr. Snyder developed techniques for identifying and characterizing the functions of thousands of genes and the proteins they encode simultaneously.  One method developed in Dr. Snyder’s lab was the ChIP chip procedure for studying the hundreds of gene targets controlled by protein regulators. Dr. Snyder’s laboratory found that a major difference between species derives from how genes are regulated; this work is valuable for understanding how humans and chimpanzees are different. His laboratory also developed protein microarrays which allow researchers to discover the functions of proteins, and how they are regulated; they are also valuable for drug discovery because they help determine which drugs bind to which proteins to exert their effects.
        Among his many awards and honors, Dr. Snyder received the 1987 Pew Scholar Award and the 2000 Burroughs Wellcome Scholar Award. He has been elected to the board of directors of the Genetics Society of America and is president of the US Human Proteome Organization. He has published extensively and founded Protometrix, a company that manufactures protein chips that can be used by other labs for drug discovery. Dr. Snyder encourages young people to “be curious and do your own thing.”  He thoroughly enjoys his work and believes that discovering what you really like to do, asking questions and solving puzzles goes a long way in science.

        Imagine fluids flowing up the side of a container, rather than down. Now imagine levitated vehicles transporting us as if we were suspended in space. And finally, can you imagine super powerful computers that rely on qubits (quantum mechanical bits) to process information, enabling these computers to decode complex encryptions that otherwise are considered indecipherable? These are only a few of the many possibilities created by work being done in the field of quantum mechanical matter, a field of study that is of particular interest to Dr. William Stwalley, Chair of the Physics Department at the University of Connecticut and recipient of the 2005 Connecticut Medal of Science Award as well as the William F. Meggers Award of the Optical Society of America for outstanding work in spectroscopy, and the Chancellor’s Research Excellence Award at the University of Connecticut (UConn).
        Dr. Stwalley was born in Glendale, California, but because of his father’s work as a quality control expert with Douglas Aircraft, his family moved many times in the southern California area. He fondly recalls those early years in Santa Monica, when he lived only eleven blocks from the beach and in the summertime, on his way home from the beach, he frequented a comic shop where he bought used comics for only a penny. He still has his comic book collection, including Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge, and at least one rare comic, valued today at somewhat more than a penny.
    </p>

    <p>
        While a student at Fullerton High School, the young Bill Stwalley found encouragement for his interest in mathematics from an “outstanding teacher, Mr. Redfern.” Mr. Redfern took Bill and his fellow students to regional and statewide math competitions where Bill not only won a slide rule and a scientific encyclopedia that he still has today, but he “got to see lots of other students and see how well we performed relative to others in California.” Later, he completed his undergraduate education at Cal Tech, where he majored in physical chemistry and began the study of diatomic molecules that he believes are “simple to understand and understand well.” After receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard University, Dr. Stwalley continued research on these molecules and studied the very unique ways in which atoms and molecules react under extremely cold conditions, below 1°K (Kelvin). Unlike ordinary molecules, ultracold diatomic molecules do not collide like “billiard balls” and in some cases “go through each other.” Although this area currently involves basic research, there exist many possible applications of quantum mechanical matter.  Dr. Stwalley expects many significant examples to evolve in the next few decades.
        Dr. Stwalley finds UConn to be a very exciting environment because of the work being done on ultracold science and the contribution he is able to make by educating graduate students and “teaching them how to think well and develop their own ideas.” He believes that “young people need to know how to ask questions and know what they don’t know.” Dr. Stwalley has enjoyed observing his three granddaughters and their love for science, although he is concerned with the challenge of “stimulating scientific interest in young children and then maintaining that interest as children mature, particularly in light of competition from many forms of entertainment.” Dr. Stwalley would most like to be remembered as a good person, a good scientist and a good teacher who has contributed many exciting ideas over the years.

        While a typical kindergartener struggles with adding together two apples and three apples, Ronald Coifman, a most precocious preschooler, was “interrogating his elders” in order to understand multiplication facts, assiduously paving the way for his ascent to Computational Harmonic Analysis, a process that makes it possible to “extract information from complex patterns.” Dr. Coifman, best known for his work on wavelet packets—a mathematical shorthand for compressing and restoring images and sound—is a professor at Yale University. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received the DARPA Sustained Excellence Award in 1996, as well as the Connecticut Medal of Science. He received the 1999 Pioneer Award from the International Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the 1999 National Medal of Science.
        Dr. Coifman grew up in Tel Aviv. His parents were multi-lingual: his father spoke ten languages, and his mother was fluent in six. Because of the diverse population of newly developing Israel, Ronald was exposed to several different languages being spoken among his parents and neighbors all in a day. Since Dr. Coifman perceives math as a linguistic entity, complete with patterns and structures, his early exposure and facility to think in many different languages became a fundamental building block for his work, helping him extract information and transcribe that information into a mathematical language that he would later use to represent digital files.
        His father was a chemical engineer and a “prolific inventor” who served as his mentor, engaging young Ronald in “extensive discussions on science and technology.” His father however, was not the only one to inspire him. Dr. Coifman recalls that the best teacher he ever had was his high school math teacher, Dr. Marshak, whom he credits with teaching him how to read. How to read? Of course, Ronald knew how to <em>read</em> in high school, but according to Dr. Coifman, what is too often assumed to be reading is merely skimming pages for content. What Dr. Marshak taught him was not how to simply read the words printed on a page, but how to systematically analyze mathematical constructs and question his understanding before progressing to the next level of complexity.
    <p></p>
        Dr. Coifman continued his education in Switzerland at the University of Geneva, majoring in mathematics and physics. He earned his PhD from the University of Geneva in 1965. Dr. Coifman states, “My work enables efficient representations of digital files, such as images, music, or scientific data.  Various compression algorithms now in use such as JPEG or MPEG for image and video files are based on these methods.  In our age, the ability to make sense out of massive digital data sets, whether medical data for diagnostics, or economic data for planning, or web documents is essential. Computational Harmonic Analysis is a basic component to enable this progress.” Currently, Dr. Coifman is working on projects to understand the mechanisms of learning, both machine and biological. He notes that some rudimentary but powerful mathematical foundations for such processes exist and can be used to organize and extract knowledge from vast digital data from medical to musical.
        Dr. Coifman would like to impress upon young people that “mathematics permeates every activity in the information age. Just as it is essential to understand basic aspects of the law to survive and navigate the shoals of commerce, it is just as important to be proficient in the basics of mathematical thinking and organization.  It is not difficult, but like a sport activity, it requires serious effort and training.”

        Frederic Richards remembers when chemistry sets “were allowed to actually do something.” Those were the good ol’ days, when a chemistry set could cause explosions and kids had fun observing smoke rise from mixing and heating mysterious substances. Dr. Richards spent his childhood in the company of his older sister Marianna, who served as a “role model and made sure that I would be a good chemist.” Later, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy, where the science department permitted students access to the labs outside of class hours, cementing his “commitment to a scientific career.” Marianna was not to be disappointed. Dr. Frederic Richards became Sterling Professor Emeritus of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale University and has earned numerous awards, including the Pfizer-Paul Lewis Award in enzyme chemistry, the Kai Linderstrom-Lang Award of the Danish Academy of Science, the Merck Award from the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the Protein Society’s Stern and Moore Award and the 1995 Connecticut Medal of Science Award. For more than half a century, his work has informed protein chemistry. Dr. Richards’ research enhanced the understanding of protein assembly, enabling researchers to manipulate the protein molecule and even change its biological function.
        According to Dr. Richards, “for those with a scientific bent, MIT was the obvious choice for college in 1943.” While studying at MIT, he took a physics course in X-ray diffraction that “determined the direction of his future research.” After graduation from MIT, it was Marianna who once again helped set his direction by encouraging him to pursue a PhD program at Harvard University, where he studied proteins—their composition, cellular dimensions, density and structure. In 1955, Dr. Richards made his debut at Yale. Although he would eventually spend all of his scientific career at Yale, he admitted to never really feeling that he was a “Yale man,” since he had attended Harvard.
    </p>

        During his tenure at Yale, Dr. Richards primarily focused on the Ribonuclease-S project in which he and his colleagues studied the relationship between the structure of a protein in a crystal and its comparable form in a solution. According to Dr. Richards, his research has “profound implications for the biotechnology industry. In creating drugs, for example, people are applying this knowledge to develop inhibitors for enzymes, which would prevent the growth of deadly viruses.”
        “Dr. Richards’ contributions to the field of biophysics have been substantial, not only in his approach to research and discovery, but also in regard to his uncompromising integrity and willingness to work with others,” said Seamus Levine-Wilkinson, a graduate student in the Biology Department in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at John Hopkins University, where Dr. Richards was a guest lecturer in June 2006. In his paper entitled, “Whatever Happened to the Fun? An Autobiographical Investigation,” Dr. Richards says that he is concerned for the future of students and researchers because following a “brief apprenticeship phase” there is less time for the fun of research. He would like to see the “fun component reinstated.”
