# Connecticut Medal of Science and Technology Kiosk
**About**
This is a replacement kiosk for the Connecticut Medal of Science and Medal of Technology award winners.
The previous kiosk was a webpage that ran off of some outdated javascript which began to break. This is an updated system used to introduce a few new technologies to the Connecticut Science center ecosystem. The first of which is Docker, establishing a containerized project running live on the floor. While it's a local container, it's still the first step in advancing the science center's modernization of exhibits. The second of which is Blazor, a new framework using C# to replace javascript code making a web application into a unified front and back-end language.
